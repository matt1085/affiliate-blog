**What Makes Solar Panels Affordable?**

So, why are some solar panel systems more affordable than others? The main factors that contribute to a lower cost are:

* **System size**: Smaller systems require fewer and less expensive components, making them a more budget-friendly option.
* **Manufacturer reputation**: Companies that have been in the industry for longer and have a good track record of producing quality panels tend to charge higher prices.
